# [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SUSE/catapult.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SUSE/catapult) Catapult

    $> git clone https://github.com/SUSE/catapult.git && cd catapult
    $> make all

This will start a local [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) cluster
and deploy kubecf on top of it. Remove everything with `make clean`.

Next, check the [First steps wiki page](https://github.com/SUSE/catapult/wiki/First-steps)
or do:

    $> make help
    $> make help-all


# Description

Catapult is a CI implementation for [KubeCF](https://github.com/SUSE/kubecf),
[SCF](https://github.com/SUSE/scf) &
[Stratos](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stratos),
designed from the ground-up to work locally. This allows iterating and using it
for manual tests and development of the products, in addition to running it in
your favourite CI scheduler (Concourse, Gitlabâ€¦).

Catapult supports several k8s backends: can create CaaSP4, GKE, EKS clusters on its
own, and you can bring your own cluster with the "imported" backend.

It is implemented as a little lifecycle manager (a finite state machine), written
with Makefiles and Bash scripts.

The deployments achieved with Catapult are not production ready; don't expect
them to be in the future either. They are for developing and testing.

It also contains some goodies to aid in development and testing deployments (see
`make module-extra-*`).

To use it in a CI, like travis, see for example:
* [.travis.yml](https://github.com/SUSE/catapult/blob/master/.travis.yml) on this
repository, to CI Catapult itself
* [kubecf post-publish](https://github.com/SUSE/kubecf/tree/master/.concourse)

# Documentation

For now, all documentation is in the [project wiki](https://github.com/SUSE/catapult/wiki).

# Contributing

Please run catapult's linting, unit tests, integration tests, etc for a full TDD
experience, as PRs are gated through them (see "build status" label):

     $> make catapult-tests

Debug catapult with `DEBUG_MODE=true`.

You can get your local development for [SCF](https://github.com/SUSE/scf)
or [KubeCF](https://github.com/SUSE/kubecf), with all needed catapult deps, with:

    $> docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -ti --rm splatform/catapult:latest dind

Check out [Run in Docker](https://github.com/SUSE/catapult/wiki/Run-in-Docker)
page on the wiki for more options.
